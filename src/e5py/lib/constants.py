SPLASH_HELP = "\nE5 is a generalized data entry program intended "
SPLASH_HELP += "for archaeologists but likely useful for others as well.  It works with a "
SPLASH_HELP += "configuration file where the data entry fields are defined.  Importantly, E5 "
SPLASH_HELP += "makes it simple to make entry in one field conditional on values previously "
SPLASH_HELP += "entered for other fields.  The goal is to make data entry fast, efficient "
SPLASH_HELP += "and error free.\n\n"
SPLASH_HELP += "E5 is a complete, from scratch re-write of E4.  It is backwards compatible "
SPLASH_HELP += "with E4 configuration files, but it supports a great many new features. "
SPLASH_HELP += "For one, it is now built on Python to be cross-platform compatible, and the "
SPLASH_HELP += "source code is available at GitHub.  E5 will run on Windows, Mac OS, Linux "
SPLASH_HELP += "and Android tablets and phones.  For this reason and others, E5 now uses an "
SPLASH_HELP += "open database format.  All data are stored in human readable, ASCII formatted "
SPLASH_HELP += "JSON files.  Data can also be exported to CSV files for easy import into any "
SPLASH_HELP += "database, statistics or spreadsheet software.\n\n"
SPLASH_HELP += "To start using this program, you will need to open CFG file.  Example CFG files "
SPLASH_HELP += "and documentation on writing your own CFG file can be found at the E5 GitHub site."
